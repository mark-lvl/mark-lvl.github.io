During last year I've tried numerous ways to teach myself Data Science and
it was totally FAILURE until a few months ago which I changed my mind and
changed my learning method too.
Initially, I was thinking being a Data Scientist means having grasp
understanding about every deep detail of math and statistics. So, I devoted
months and weeks and days just reading about Linear Algebra, Calculus,
statistics and probability.
It was so frustrating just to read pure theoretical materials
without any motivations and seeing any clear outcome.
